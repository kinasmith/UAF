##Capacitive Discharge Welder

based off of this [project.](http://www.instructables.com/id/Capacitive-Discharge-CD-Welder-for-battery-tabs/) and this [project](http://zeva.com.au/Projects/SpotWelderV2/). 

Included in this repo is the Control code (for arduino Pro Mini), and the PCB files I used. The Capacitor Board is slightly too large for the free version of Eagle (sorry!).
